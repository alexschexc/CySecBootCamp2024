Scenario: A Wild USB Appears!
Suppose you found a USB drive laying on the ground. How much of a threat could 
that really be?

In groups, consider the following scenario and questions:

When plugged into a computer, the USB drive immediately executes running code.

How is a USB drive able to do this?
the USB drive's firmware can be altered to function as a Human Input Devide (HID) and then prepackaged with a code payload called a "ducky script" which then can execute instructions on the target machine.

Why can't our computer stop the drive from running?
HIDs are by default trusted devices ALWAYS and thus circumvent any kind of protections.

How might we defend against USBs like this?
The best way is to just noot plug in the USB ever. The next best thing to do would be to setup a virtual machine that will serve as a sandbox for potential code execution from a bad usb/ rubber ducky.
